# Untangled 🧠✨

**Untangled** is a decision-support tool built in React to help reduce overwhelm and support users — especially those with ADHD or anxiety — in getting unstuck.

The idea came from my own experience: sometimes I know I need to do *something*, but I can’t decide what. This app helps break that paralysis with kind nudges and smart suggestions based on how you're feeling.

It’s my second project in my frontend dev portfolio, and one I’m especially proud of because it merges technical learning with something deeply personal and useful.

### 🔍 What It Does
- Suggests actions based on user inputs like mood, energy, and need
- Built-in 5-minute motivational timer to help you start (instead of spiral)
- Shuffle and save suggestions that resonate
- Dynamically recommends movies (via TMDB API) for when you just need a break
- Uses local storage to persist saved ideas and countdown state

### 💻 Tech Stack
- React (functional components and useState)
- CSS for styling (custom + responsive)
- TMDB API integration
- Local storage for persistence
- Accessibility practices in progress

### Why I Built This
I’ve spent the last few years working in social media and digital strategy, with a focus on mental health, equity, and community impact — helping people navigate big life transitions, burnout, and systemic barriers. I have a master’s in clinical social work, and I’m currently retraining in frontend development through Skillcrush to build tools that are both functional and human-centered.

**Untangled** born out of supporting my fiancé through challenges with focus, stress, and decision-making — and realizing how often we both needed something simple to cut through the noise. I wanted to build a tool that felt supportive, empowering, and genuinely helpful during those stuck moments.

### What’s Next
- Add sound or animation to make the timer more motivating
- Let users create custom suggestions
- Add dark mode and accessibility refinements
- Expand suggestions with behavioral science research

### Let’s Connect
I’m Alex Walker — a social strategist turned developer, now building tools that blend tech, care, and community. I'm currently seeking a junior frontend dev role on a mission-driven team.

Let’s create things that help people feel more in control — and less alone.
